# STL-Contracts

This project use CI to check [solhint](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/) and [slither-analyzer](https://github.com/crytic/slither) result.

If you want to modify the check rules. Follow the next steps.

## solhint

solhint config can be declared in `.solhint.json`, which can be generated by:

```sh
npx -y solhint --init
```

Then modify the generated `.solhint.json` manually. Default config should be:

```json
{
  "extends": "solhint:default"
}
```

You can find all rules and configs here: https://github.com/protofire/solhint/blob/master/docs/rules.md

## slither-analyzer

slither-analyzer config can be declared in `slither.config.json`. Slither runs all its detectors by default. If you want to include or exclude some detectors, you can declare in `slither.config.json`:

```json
{
  "detectors_to_run": "detector1,detector2",
  // or
  "detectors_to_exclude": "detector1,detector2"
  // ... Other config ...
}
```

All detectors and descriptions can be found here: https://github.com/crytic/slither#detectors
